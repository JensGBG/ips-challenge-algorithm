# Algorithm

This repository contains my submission to the IPS-coding-challenge, as well as explanation of my work.  

**Please run the following files on:**  
Python 3.12.0  
Numpy 2.0.0  
Numba 0.60.0  
scipy 1.15.0  
*pandas 2.2.3

## Explanation of files  
main.py: Final algorithm for positions_large.xyz.  
Explanation-of-Algorithm.pdf: Explanation of algorithm.  
workbench_simulation.ipynb: Jupyter notebook for simulating algorithm with different parameters.

OBS! The algorithm in main.py is optimized for the dataset positions_large.xyz, and not positions.xyz.
