This repository contains my submission to the IPS-coding-challenge, as well as explanation of my work.

Files:  
main.py: Final algorithm for positions_large.xyz.  
Explanation-of-Algorithm.pdf: Explanation of algorithm.  
workbench_simulation.ipynb: Jupyter notebook for simulating algorithm with different parameters.

OBS! The algorithm in main.py is optimized for the dataframe positions_large.xyz, and not positions.xyz.
